## Introduction

This repository provides information regarding the construction of a
polygenic risk score (PRS) for Alzhaimer (AD) that we developed (AD-PRS)
in manuscript A polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease constructed
using APOE-region variants has stronger association than APOE alleles
with mild cognitive impairment in Hispanic/Latino adults in the U.S.

First, it provides instructions for constructing the HTN-PRS based on
summary statistics from GWAS. We provide the relevant summary statistics
(see folder “Summary\_Statistics\_for\_PRS\_construction”), as well as
code for using them to construct the PRS.

Second, this repository also provides code the we used for the analyses
in the manuscript (see folder “Code”).
